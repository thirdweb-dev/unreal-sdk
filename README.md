# Thirdweb Unreal Engine SDK Plugin

A Code Plugin for Unreal Engine that enables developers to create thirdweb Private Key Wallets, In-App Wallets and
Smart Wallets for their games and applications. The plugin provides a simple API and blueprints to interact with
wallets, login with email or socials as well as create Smart Wallet session keys.

With this plugin, you can keep the onboarding of your users in-client and grant a session key to your
[thirdweb Engine](https://portal.thirdweb.com/engine) powered backend to interact with the blockchain,
no signature in sight.

## Supported Unreal Engine Versions

Thirdweb adheres to Unreal Engine's Marketplace Guidelines in supporting the 3 most recent versions[^1].
We aim to release an updated plugin version as expediently as possible once a minor version change has released.
If you or your company require compatibility with an older version, please reach out to [support][support-url].

The plugin's core logic is built from Rust, making it lightning-fast and minimizing the clutter in your Unreal project.
