# Thirdweb Unreal Engine SDK Plugin

A Code Plugin for Unreal Engine that enables developers to create thirdweb Private Key Wallets, In-App Wallets and Smart Wallets for their games and applications. The plugin provides a simple API and blueprints to interact with wallets, login with email or socials as well as create Smart Wallet session keys.

With this plugin, you can keep the onboarding of your users in-client and grant a session key to your [thirdweb Engine](https://portal.thirdweb.com/engine) powered backend to interact with the blockchain, no signature in sight.

## Installation

In addition to the source code provided, the plugin is available on the [Unreal Marketplace][marketplace-url].

The plugin's core logic is built from Rust, making it lightning-fast and minimizing the clutter in your Unreal project.
